Original Proposal

GOOD:
X I would like to update the backend to better handle some of the features detailed in the Android projects. The core problem I discovered is that the databases are not designed to handle the ownership of multiple pieces equipment of equipment amongst multiple game objects.
X Actual implementation of the GameEngine would be keen.

BETTER:

* Required objects and qualifications to start certain Accomplishments.
BEST:
* Graphics of any kind, but I see that coming into play for the final project. I have a couple ideas that probably go beyond the scope of this project.

First steps
X Successful porting of the Android code to iOS to match the feature set. 
X Update model (database) to better manage equipment

Second Steps
X Add the creation, deletion, and linking of core game objects to other game objects (i.e., create a new Task and add it as an Accomplishment to a Location, transfer ownership of an Equipment from a Task to the Player).

Final Steps
X Creation and deletion of games themselves
* Some kind of graphics—maybe a Location map during play and linking.
