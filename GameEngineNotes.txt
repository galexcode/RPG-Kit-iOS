Based on Pathfinder, an fork of the d20 System, but free to use without license.

That system is specific to fantasy, so this engine, while based upon Pathfinder in 
terms of abilities, systemic implementation, and number ranges, is much more generalized 
in nature.

Core game play

Player is paired to an accomplishment.

The accomplishment has a difficulty value typically between 1 and 20 but can be higher
if needed.

The player rolls a number between 1 and 20. The core mechanics is if the player's roll 
is higher than the accomplishment's difficulty class, the player wins. If the roll 
is less than or equal to the accomplishment's roll, the player loses. 

The accomplishment also lists abilities upon which the player can apply bonuses to 
their roll depending on their own attributes. In addition, equipment used by the player
may have bonuses listed that add to the player's roll if the equipment is applicable to
the accomplishment. So, the player's roll is constructed as such:

[base attempt roll] + [ability modifiers] + [equipment modifiers]

By way of example, given an accomplishment with a difficulty of 12 and the accomplishment
lists Intelligence and Dexterity as being applicable abilities, and given a player with
a Intelligence of 13 and Dexterity of 12, the rolls would look like this should the 
player roll a 10:

10 + [2 + 1] = 13 vs 12

...which means the player wins to accomplishment.

Reward vs Risk

Accomplishments list money and equipment that can be passed onto the player should 
they win their roll. Conversely, accomplishments also list money and equipement that
can be taken away from the player should they lose.
